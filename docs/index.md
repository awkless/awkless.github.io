# Welcome to Awklesses' Little Website!

This is the entry point to a couple of cool little things that I am working on,
or have worked on in the past. Have a look around, you might find something
you like!

All commits and tags for any coding project I have created is signed using my
public GPG key. I highly recommend that you verify the authenticity of any piece
of code I created through my public key via `git-verify-tag` or
`git-verify-commit`.

My public key is hosted at [keys.opengpg.org][pub-gpg-key]. Take a look through
the [usage guide][usage-guide] for directions on obtaining my key for whatever
OpenPGP software product you like to use!

Be sure to verify that the copy of my public key you get matches this
fingerprint (spaces added for readability):

> 8A14 E0DF A45D F309 72BA  BA29 A39C 4170 CBB2 3146

If your copy does not match the fingerprint above, or Git tells you that some
commit or tag is compromised, then send me an email at <jasonpena@awkless.com>
with proper evidence. Do not submit a bug request to any of my projects
regarding security concerns.
